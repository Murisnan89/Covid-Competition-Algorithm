Time Complexity Analysis of PSO Algorithm

Ø Population Initialisation (lines 13-22):
- Loop to initialise particle position = O(N*dim)
Ø Initial Fitness Evaluation (lines 24-29):
- The loop for fitness evaluation takes O(N) time .
Ø Iteration (lines 31-59):
- The main PSO iteration loop takes O(max_Iter) time.
- Inside, there is a loop for each particle (lines 33-58).
- Each particle iteration involves simple mathematical operations and fitness evaluation, which has a time complexity of O(dim)

Total time complexity = O(N*dim*max_Iter)
