Time Complexity Analysis of PSO Algorithm

 Initialise X and V using nested loops:
- The dimension of matrices X and V is dim * dim, so the complexity is O(dim2).
 Loop to calculate initial fitness:
- Iterate N times, where each iteration requires evaluation of the fitness function, which has O(1) complexity.
- Using the best value so far requires a comparison for each iteration, with complexity O(dim).
 Main loop for maximum iterations:
- Iterate max_Iter times, where each iteration consists of a loop for each particle (N times).
- Within the particle loops, there are operations with complexity O(1) and O(dim).
- Thus, overall, the time complexity of the algorithm is mainly determined by the maximum number of iterations and the size of the feature dimension (dim), and is expressed as O(max_Iter * N * dim2).

Total time complexity = O(dim^2* N * max_Iter)
