Time Complexity Analysis of ACO Algorithm

Ø Iteration Ants (While Loop):
- Number of iterations: 'max_iter' = O(max_Iter)
Ø Matrix Initialisation:
- Initialise the matrices 'tau' and 'eta' with size 'dim*dim' = O(dim2)
Ø Ants Iteration (first for loop):
- Number of iterations : 'N' (Number of Ants Population)
- Time complexity in the first for loop:
- Selection of 'num_feat' : O (1)
- Initialise 'X(I,1)': O (1)
- Iteration builds the tour: O (num_feat)
- Time complexity of first for loop = O(N*num_feat)
Ø Ants iteration (second for loop):
- Number of iterations :'N'
- Time complexity in the second for loop:
- Transformation to binary form 'X-bin': O(dim)
- Time complexity of second for loop = O(N*dim)
Ø Fitness Evaluation and Global Update:
- Fitness evaluation for each ant: O(N)
- Global Update: O(N)
Ø Pheromone Update:
- Pheromone update on 'tauK' and 'tauG' = O(N*dim)
Ø Pheromone Evaporation:
- Pheromone evaporation on 'tau' matrix = O(dim2)

Total time complexity = O( max_Iter) + O(dim2) + O(N*num_feat) + O(N*dim) + O(N) + O(N*dim) + O(dim2)
Simplified = O(dim^2 + max_iter + N*num_feat + N*dim)
